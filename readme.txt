StackAd provides an easy way to advertise open source projects on your blog with minimal effort.

== Description ==

Want to display advertisements for open source projects on your blog? StackAd makes it easy to do this. The Stack Exchange network consists of sites with questions like [this one](http://meta.askubuntu.com/q/2158) that allow users to submit community ads that are displayed on the site's home page. Thanks to the [Stack Exchange API](http://stackapps.com), the data required to display the advertisements can be retrieved easily and used to display the ads on your blog.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the directory `stackad` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
1. Add the widget to the page by visiting 'Appearance -> Widgets'.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Are all Stack Exchange sites supported? =

Yes, all Stack Exchange sites are supported.

= Can I have multiple instances of StackAd on the same page? =

You sure can. There is nothing stopping you from having as many instances as you wish.
